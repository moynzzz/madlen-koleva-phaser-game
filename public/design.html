                    <h1>Concept</h1>
                    <p>The main game idea aims to provide players with opportinuty to play an adventurous platform game together and help each other reach the end of each level. The main obstacles in the game take form of locked ways which players need to unlock by collaborating with each other. Furthermore, players will encounter enemies and will need to use strategy moves in order to reach the end of the level.</p>

                    <ul class="pl-3">
                        <li>LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game - This Lego-themed, action-adventure video game was released in 2005 for PC following the story from Star Wars: Episode 1. The game allows two players to play on the same computer and assist each other on trying to fight droids, unlock doors and pass through different obstacles. Players are allowed to unlock and play different heroes from the saga (Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon Jinn, Padme, R2D2, C-3PO and others) and change through already unlocked heroes while in-game in order to use their special abilities. Although not a 2D genre, the game is similar to Yannie & Brannie in means of using a group effort to pass each level.</li>

                        <li>Ibb & Obb – Another team-based oriented game is the puzzle platform video game developed by Sparpweed Games for PS3 and Windows. In the game two players collaborate in a world where gravity goes both ways (up and down) in order to get each other through each level. The game is focused on team play and strategy which is the main inspiration behind the planned for this project game.</li>

                        <li>Super Mario – This famous platform video game series was created by Nintendo and first released in 1985. The game follows the adventure of Mario (Nintendo’s mascot) in the fictional Mushroom Kingdom as the player can run and jump across platforms and enemies in order to pass each level. The player mechanics in Yannie & Brannie are inspired from Super Mario because of their simplicity and ability to make the player feel freedom while moving across levels and kill enemies.</li>

                    <h1>Gameplay and Mechanics </h1>
                    <p>The game consists of three scenes – menu scene, in-game scene, and game over/win scene. In the menu scene the player will be able to start playing the game and choose his character, read the game instructions, check out the leader board and/or exit the game.</p>
                    <p>Once in-game the players enter a level full of obstacles including different enemies and blockages that need to be unlocked. Each player has a total of three lives at the begining of the game, however, players can collect additional lives throughout the level. If a player loses all of his lives the level will be restarted (applies to both players) and they have to start from the beginning. The main goal of the game is to take Yannie and Brannie throughout the level to their home (represented by a beautiful pixel art house). The level is then considered completed and the players are presented their respective players’ score and they can then continue to the next level of the game or return to the menu scene. Players' score is equal for both players and does not reset on level clear. When all levels are completed the score will be automatically saved in the leader board. The game consist of two levels and more will be added in future development.</p>
                    <p>The game aims to provide adventurous and enjoyable environment where players can dive into in their free time and work together towards a common goal as well as explore thematic levels and use their strategy skills.</p>
                    <ul class="pl-3">
                        <li>Player movement – while in game players will be able to move with the arrow keys on the keyboard. This limited player movement is inspired from games such as Super Mario where players do not need to aim and shoot at enemies and/or use special combat mechanics to kill them.</li>
                        <li>Killing enemies – enemies in the game take form of eagles and opossums. Players can kill enemies by jumping onto them. If players collide with enemies in another way one life per collision will be taken from the respective player.</li>
                        <li>Unlocking the path – players need to unlock the path in front of them in order to reach the end of the level. This system is designed to work in the following way: a pair of cranks for each blockage will be spread across the level for the players to find. After finding them the players need to stay on top of them at the same time and the respective blockage will blow open.</li>
